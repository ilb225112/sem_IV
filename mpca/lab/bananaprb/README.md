## Problem Statements

### 1. Selection Sort in ARM Assembly
**Description:**  
Implement the **Selection Sort** algorithm in ARM Assembly. The algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion and swapping it with the element at the current position in the sorted portion.

**Input:**
- An array of integers stored in memory.
- The size of the array, **N**, will be provided as part of the input.

**Output:**
- The array will be sorted in ascending order.

**Constraints:**
- The array contains integer values.
- The size of the array **N** is small (5 to 10 elements).

### 2. Prefix Expression Evaluation in ARM Assembly
**Description:**  
Write an ARM Assembly program to evaluate a **Prefix expression** using a stack. The program supports the basic arithmetic operations: **addition (+)** and **subtraction (-).**

**Input Format:**
- The Prefix expression is represented as a **string** (array of characters).
- The expression terminates with a null character ('\0').

**Output Format:**
- The program outputs the **evaluated result** of the Prefix expression.

**Assumptions:**
- The operands are **single-digit non-negative integers (1-9)**.
- The expression contains **no spaces**.
- The input is **well-formed** (no errors in operators or operands).
