1. **Write an ALP (Assembly Language Program) to perform the addition of two numbers:**
   
   a) **64-bit addition**
   
   b) **128-bit addition**, where the result is saved in a register and reused.

   Example (64-bit addition):

|   | 32 + 32 bit|
|---|--------|
|   | R1 &nbsp;R0 | 
| `+` | R3 &nbsp;R2 | 
|---|--------|
| C  | R5 &nbsp;  R4 |

 *(You may store the result back into R3, R2.)*

2. **Write an ALP to find the 2's complement of a number using only `MOV` and `RSB`.**

3. **Write an ALP to find the 1's complement (`NOT`) of a number using `MOV` and bitwise logical instructions.**

4. **Write an ALP to subtract two numbers if they are equal; otherwise, add them.**

5. **Write an ALP to check if a number is even or odd.**
