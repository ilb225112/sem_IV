1. **Write an ALP (Assembly Language Program) to perform the addition of two numbers:**
   
   a) **64-bit addition**
   
   b) **128-bit addition**, where the result is saved in a register and reused.

   Example (64-bit addition):

|   | 32 + 32 bit|
|---|--------|
|   | R1 &nbsp;R0 | 
| `+` | R3 &nbsp;R2 | 
|---|--------|
| C  | R5 &nbsp;  R4 |

 *(You may store the result back into R3, R2.)*
